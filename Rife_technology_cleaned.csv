Can you tell me if the price iof the Rife machine includes shipping and handling and other fees as well?,"The price includes free international shipping. We use a forwarder who ships these machines for us with UPS, which is 100% trackable with a 3-5 day delivery time. . There is usually a small import tax payable, which works out to approx. $70 based on the commercial invoice value"
how long will it take to reach me here in USA?,"We are usually able to ship within 2-3 days of payment, so the total lead time is approx. a week"
"What happens if anything gets broken during shipping and handling, will it be replaced?","The machines are shipped with insurance, so if something does break during transit it will be replaced. However the machines are shipped in a protective padded bag, packed inside a larger box with 2” polystyrene padding to keep the risk of damage to a minimum. We’ve shipped several of the Rife machines across the world and haven’t had any cases of damage during shipment."

Is there maintenance and how often?,The machine requires no maintenance as its solid state. As it sweeps through the frequencies every 10 secs or so it does not require calibration either
What is the procedure if any repair is needed? ,"Regarding repairs if necessary, it would have to be shipped back to Cape Town to our engineer at this point. They are however very sturdy and reliable and we have not had a comeback in 4 years yet. We design it to operate well within its limits."
Why is Real Rife better than GB4000 Rife (respectively US $4700 v US $1800) ,"Re the GB 4000, This is a handheld generator that does not do what Rife originally did. It is the MOPA part of it that does do what Rife did to a large extent. We have tested one here a few times that a friend has. I explain the many differences on our Skype Zoom calls. With this tech the devil is always in the detail."
If understood correctly Real Rife is running all frequencies simultaneously in 20 min v GB4000 Rife is running up to 8 frequencies one after the other. What is the rationale and why? - ,"This requires a long explanation and a demonstration, it is something we can answer on the Zoom meetings where we can also demonstrate with a spectrum analyser and oscilloscope."

I would like to know more about being able to tell if woman has a hormonal imbalance in her body and if the hormones are too high or too low?  Please let me know what the doctor says.  I have taken your Live Blood Online classes in the past and have not been able to start using the microscope that I purchased from you.,"The machine is only used for treatment, it doesn’t perform an analysis. Rife treatment works as a radio-frequency based antibiotic, so it’s very useful in dealing with any type of infection. Rife also had great results with cancer, and ascribed the results to the cancer virus he identified being destroyed by Rife treatment. A series of treatment also improves many of the indicators in live & dry blood analysis, since it assists in clearing all the pathogens from the terrain.

 

We can detect signs of hormonal imbalance in live & dry blood analysis, but not specific levels of hormones. Do you have any questions on the microscope that I can help with?"
