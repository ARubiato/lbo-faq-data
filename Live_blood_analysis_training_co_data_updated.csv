Question,Answer 
Why Choose Live Blood Online?,
Do I need to have a microscope to join the training course,"You don't need a microscope to join the training course but you will need it to submit your case study after the training course ends, to receive your certificate.We recommend you watch the video here https://livebloodonline.com/microscopes/ before buying your microscope, darkfield microscopes for LBA are very specialised and we want to help attendees avoid making any expensive mistakes."
Who is the LBA online training course for?,"The training course is open to anyone but it is primarily geared to existing natural health practitioners including naturopathic doctors, nutritionists, colonic hydration & detox practitioners, osteopaths, holistic specialists etc., to practice on it's own or to work with and complement other practices."
,
,
,
"I already studied Live Blood Analysis but don’t feel I know enough, would the course benefit me?","We have many students who studied LBA elswhere and don’t feel confident enough in their knowledge to practice. This training course is ideal for that situation. All the lessons are recorded so all the lessons and material can be repeated. The training course, the manuals and the training site cover everything you need to know to become proficient and confident in your analysis."
The course has already started can I still join?,"Yes, all the lessons are recorded so you can catch up with the video recordings at any time."
Do you supply the microscopes?,"Yes we supply microscopes for all your needs in Live & Dry Blood Analysis, please see our microscope page https://livebloodonline.com/microscopes/ and/or let us know if you would like a phone call to discuss your requirements info@livebloodonline.com"
,
Do you have any criteria for example having to be therapists already?,"The training course is open to anyone as some attendees just want to help themselves and thier family, but we are primarily geared to existing practitioners of some sort in Health, Fitness, Training, Nutrition or Naturopathy."
Can I do the course for interest without a medical background?,"Yes, we have students taking the course for general interest and/or to help their friends/family."
"I Live in USA and am on another time zone, how would that work?","We have students from all over the world in different time zones. All of the lessons are recorded so if you can’t be at your computer at the allotted time, you can view the video recording of the lesson and send your questions in to us."
"I will not be able to attend every week, is it worth me joining?","All of the lessons are recorded so if you miss a lesson, you will be able to view the video recording of the lesson and send your questions in to us."
What microscope do you recommend?,Please go to microscope page for specifications and our recommendation https://livebloodonline.com/microscopes/
What qualifications are needed to practice live blood analysis? What is the legislation around using the blood analysis and what qualifications are required to register for the course? Do I need a medical background?,"There are no formal regulations around live blood analysis, so in essence anyone can add it to their existing practice. The training course is open to anyone but is primarily geared to existing practitioners and we would expect students who intend to practice to have a diploma of some sort in Health, Fitness, Training, Nutrition or Anatomy & Physiology."
What’s the best way to get started in Live Blood Analaysis?,"To get the best start in LBA you need a really good training course of a high standard with information from all different perspectives to give a better insight. Look for a highly qualified & experienced tutor with a background in naturopathic medicine. The theory is very important, but the practical aspects of LBA are also equally important because if you’re not able to take blood samples correctly then your results won’t be reliable. Your course needs to be comprehensive and the equipment you use (your microscope system) needs to be up to the correct specifications so you’re able to use LBA to its full potential from the beginning. I’ve often seen people who want to add LBA to their practice, but who don’t want to invest in a good enough system, so they start with a very basic system that doesn’t allow them to see everything they should be able to see with LBA and they never really fully benefit from LBA. So the theory, the practical proficiency and the correct equipment are all critically important."
How long does it take to really become proficient at live blood analysis?,"We suggest at a minimum of 4 hours study a week on top of the weekly lesson. The technique of collecting the blood samples is fairly easy to master and most students are completely proficient in this within a month. Most students are also able to identify the most common anomalies correctly within 1-2 months, but it is important to have as much knowledge as possible because clients often ask questions, and some clients are sceptical, so as a practitioner you need to have as much information to draw from as possible. Most practitioners are able to start practicing after 3 months, your proficiency will constantly improve as you see more and more clients and get hands-on experience with LBA."
How much experience does a person need to start practicing LBA?,"You need to have enough practical experience with the microscope to be able to use the equipment easily and proficiently. You will also need to practice on yourself and anyone willing to let you practice on them until you feel confident enough in your abilitiy to take a good sample. Then you will need to put everything you have been taught on the training course into practise. Most practitioners are able to start practicing after 3 months, your proficiency will constantly improve as you see more and more clients and get hands-on experience with LBA."
Is Enderlein theory of pleomorphism taught in the course?,"Yes, we cover the theory of pleomorphism in detail with all the phases of development of the particular growth forms identified by Dr Enderlein. Under each anomaly we also discuss the pleomorphic perspective. The training course covers all aspects of live blood analysis so consequently is not exclusively pleomorphic."
Do you teach phase contrast or darkfield?,"The microscope systems we use are fitted with brightfield and darkfield, so the images you’ll see in the course materials would be either brightfield or darkfield. Phase contrast was developed as a less expensive option to darkfield, but even with the best phase contrast microscope systems you won’t be able to see everything you can with darkfield. That’s why we focus exclusively on brightfield and darkfield analysis of live blood."
What makes this course different from other courses?,"This training course draws from a variety of researchers, whereas other courses only offer one researcher’s viewpoint so you are likely to encounter a lot of information that is not covered in any other single course.
This course is online, interactive, with live lessons and video recordings so attendees can study anywhere in the world. Online training does away with expensive travel and accommodation costs to travel to an in-house training centre where practitioners find they have to learn a huge amount of information in a short amount of time, this is not practical and students find they are not able to take it all in.
No other course offers as much information and detail, plus an online training site with a huge database of images, videos and information.
Plus, back-up and support is provided after the training course ends."
Is the equipment easy to transport?,For air travel of the microscope you will need the original protective box packaging to send it or you may take it as hand luggage. For general transporting around we suggest a cabin bag (on wheels) fitted out with foam for protection so that you can wheel your microscope around easily. 
How often do you run the courses?,"We run training courses in January, April and September, the courses fill up quickly so do book your place in plenty of time."
I would like to know if your course is recognized in the USA? I am interested and I would love to enrol in your class if I can practice it here?,"Live blood analysis is becoming recognized all over the world especially in USA, it is a nutritional tool used in a natural health & wellness setting. You will need to adhere to your local health and safety regulations."
Would the online training be the best way to take the course or would I need hands on class?,"This training course has been designed to overcome all of the problems involved in in-house training courses. Online training has many advantages: 
This online training course consists of live interactive lessons and video recordings so attendees can study anywhere in the world in any time zone. 
Online training does away with expensive travel and accommodation costs to travel to an in-house training centre where practitioners find they have to learn a huge amount of information in a short amount of time, this is not practical and students find they are not able to take all the information in.
With online training the course material is recorded so attendees can repeat the lessons.
Attendees can study or learn whenever they want at home or office at their own time and convenience.
Attendees can concentrate on all the information, no need to take notes or try to remember everything.
Attendees can refer to the course material anywhere, anytime, as long as they have an internet connection.
Attendees get all the online back up and support needed.
"
Could you give me a brief outline of the course and how it is presented?,"The 12 weekly interactve online lessons are presented via GotoWebinar, they consist of in-depth information, videos, diagrams and pictures describing, explaining and discussing  the material in the manual. Questions are posed and answered throughout the lesson and a video recording of the lesson is then sent out to all attendees after the live webinar for those in different time zones or anyone unable to attend for any reason.
"
What are some of the common problems that people experience in setting up the new live blood analysis practice?,"The most common problem is not having the right equipment. Live blood analysis darkfield microscopes are very specialized so the microscope system needs to be up to the correct specifications to be able to use LBA to its full potential.
We often see practitoners who want to add LBA to their practice, but who don’t want to invest in a good enough system, so they start with a very basic system that doesn’t allow them to see everything they should be able to see with LBA, consequently they and their clients never really fully benefit from LBA.

Is there any scientific proof about Live blood analysis?,https://livebloodonline.com/the-history-of-live-blood-analysis/
I would like to know if the training includes recommendations that you give to clients to correct the imbalances or improve the internal terrain depending on what is found or is it just the technique used for the microscope and how to identify the microforms?,"The training includes recommendations to give to clients to correct the imbalances and/or improve the internal terrain depending on what is found.
Solutions are given for all of the anomalies found in the analysis, you will find them in the manual provided. 
LBA is not just the technique used to identify the anomaly, we provide the treatment.
Further live blood analysis then also shows if the treatment is successful."
"i'll like to know if you teach us to recognise borrelia, babesia bacteria please?","We don’t cover the identification of borrelia and babesia bacteria specifically, since they can’t be identified on morphology alone. We do provide information on what spirochetes and other cell wall deficient bacteria look like and what has been seen in samples of patients with Babesiosis, as well as other microbes that can be identified in the blood. We can’t diagnose these infections with live blood analysis alone though, so further tests are used to confirm the diagnosis when there are red flags in the analysis."
"Does your training include identification of lyme and co-infections?
","We don’t cover Lyme specifically. We do provide information on what spirochetes and other cell wall deficient bacteria look like and how to find them in blood samples, but we are not able to diagnose a Lyme infection with live blood analysis."

What kind of illness we we be able to detect from the live blood analysis?,
Will we have protocols to offer when we find anomalies in the blood?,"Yes, they are discussed in the course and in detail in the manual"
"How accurate live blood analysis

","Yes it is. There are some states in the US where the medical council has tried to prevent the practice of LBA, but the technique is not regulated and there are practitioners in those states that are using LBA. Instead of using the term “live blood analysis” they say they’re using it as an educational tool to educate their clients on nutrition, diet & lifestyle. The only real risk is when practitioners make claims about being able to diagnose medical conditions, which is not what LBA should be used for. We cover the legal aspects in detail during the course to ensure that our attendees can use the technique safely without putting themselves or their clients at risk."
Will I be able to offer Blood cell analysis after the training.,
"What’s the difference between LBA and other tests used by natural health practitioners, such as the quantum analysers and biofeedback devices?",You will be able to help more people with LBA than with any other device used in natural health……

Do you offer any payment plan?,"We offer a 2 part payment plan, 50% to begin the training course and the remaining 50% on week 6 which is half way through the 12 week training course."
Are the protocols for clients included in the training course?,"Yes, all the protocols are provided in great detail as part of the training course."
What type of license do we need to get in order to work doing the blood analysis?,"There isn’t any specific association or governing body for Live blood analysis and the type of license if any will depend on your country's specific regulations if there are.

LBA is not regulated as a medical practice as it isn’t a diagnostic procedure, so any practitioner who has received training is able to use LBA. We do cover the legal aspects in more detail in the training course.

The procedure does not draw blood, just a tiny pinprick is used via a lancet as in a blood sugar test.
A procedure for removal of refuse will need to be followed, similar to what an acupuncture practice will have in place."

"Does the warranty go through you, or directly to the manufacturing company?",The warranty goes through our company Neogenesis Medical Systems.
"Are your microscopes approved by FDA, and is such approval needed? I am not familiar with requirements for microscopes, but working with other equipment, we needed to comply.",

"Which microscope do you recommend using for LBA, brightfield or dark field? Which one is best?",
I seem to have misplaced my immersion condenser oil. Can you tell me what kind to purchase?,
I am much more attracted to the darkfield images.  What would you say are the advantages of the brightfield assessment that the darkfield does not provide?,"Darkfield is far more interesting and often determines the course of action in a case, but it is important to first scan through the sample in brightfield. Brightfield is simpler to work with, so it’s easier to focus the sample and scan through it to select a suitable area. It is also easier to differentiate between the different WBCs and crystals in darkfield. Other than that we rely on darkfield for the rest of the information, so we usually only spend 5-10mins in brightfield and the balance in darkfield."
Does the monitor come with the microscope? Or do we need to purchase a monitor? If so do you have recommended specs for SID monitor? ,"The monitor is not included in the package. Any full-HD LED computer monitor with a HDMI input will be suitable. We usually recommend getting one by any well-known brand, ideally at least 24 inches large (since it’s a full-HD video you can get a monitor much larger than 24 inches if you like)."
"Of the 3 variations of Microscopy explained in Module 1, (Darkfield, Brightfield & Phase contrast, which do you personally use and find most useful?  Please explain.","We use only darkfield and brightfield as it allows for all the anomalies to be seen. Phase contrast is not used in our microscopes and training as it doesn’t allow for any other anomalies to be detected and is used mainly to avoid the cost of a professional darkfield system. We can add a phase contrast kit as an optional extra on our microscopes if it’s something a practitioner needs. However, in terms of what can be seen in the different techniques, the best combination is brightfield and a good quality oil-immersion darkfield system."
Where are your microscopes made?,Our microscopes are manufactured in Japan especially to our specifications in a factory that specializes in the manufacturing of microscopes for laboratory and surgical use and has over 40 years’ experience in producing reliable and durable systems.

Can you tell me if the price iof the Rife machine includes shipping and handling and other fees as well?,"The price includes free international shipping. We use a forwarder who ships these machines for us with UPS, which is 100% trackable with a 3-5 day delivery time. . There is usually a small import tax payable, which works out to approx. $70 based on the commercial invoice value"
how long will it take to reach me here in USA?,"We are usually able to ship within 2-3 days of payment, so the total lead time is approx. a week"
"What happens if anything gets broken during shipping and handling, will it be replaced?","The machines are shipped with insurance, so if something does break during transit it will be replaced. However the machines are shipped in a protective padded bag, packed inside a larger box with 2” polystyrene padding to keep the risk of damage to a minimum. We’ve shipped several of the Rife machines across the world and haven’t had any cases of damage during shipment."
Is there any training required for the Real Rife Machine,
Can you tell me if this price includes shipping and handling and other fees as well? And how long will it take to reach here? And if anything gets broken during shipping and handling will it be replaced?,
Will the Real Rife machine work in my country?,
Is there any warranty?,The warranty is 1 year.
Is there maintenance and how often?,The machine requires no maintenance as its solid state. As it sweeps through the frequencies every 10 secs or so it does not require calibration either
What is the procedure if any repair is needed? ,"Regarding repairs if necessary, it would have to be shipped back to Cape Town to our engineer at this point. They are however very sturdy and reliable and we have not had a comeback in 4 years yet. We design it to operate well within its limits."
Why is Real Rife better than GB4000 Rife (respectively US $4700 v US $1800) ,"Re the GB 4000, This is a handheld generator that does not do what Rife originally did. It is the MOPA part of it that does do what Rife did to a large extent. We have tested one here a few times that a friend has. I explain the many differences on our Skype Zoom calls. With this tech the devil is always in the detail."
If understood correctly Real Rife is running all frequencies simultaneously in 20 min v GB4000 Rife is running up to 8 frequencies one after the other. What is the rationale and why? - ,"This requires a long explanation and a demonstration, it is something we can answer on the Zoom meetings where we can also demonstrate with a spectrum analyser and oscilloscope."
