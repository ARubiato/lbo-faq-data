What microscope do you recommend?,Please go to microscope page for specifications and our recommendation https://livebloodonline.com/microscopes/,,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
What qualifications are needed to practice live blood analysis? What is the legislation around using the blood analysis and what qualifications are required to register for the course? Do I need a medical background?,"There are no formal regulations around live blood analysis, so in essence anyone can add it to their existing practice. The training course is open to anyone but is primarily geared to existing practitioners and we would expect students who intend to practice to have a diploma of some sort in Health, Fitness, Training, Nutrition or Anatomy & Physiology.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,Microscopes
What’s the best way to get started in Live Blood Analaysis?,"To get the best start in LBA you need a really good training course of a high standard with information from all different perspectives to give a better insight. Look for a highly qualified & experienced tutor with a background in naturopathic medicine. The theory is very important, but the practical aspects of LBA are also equally important because if you’re not able to take blood samples correctly then your results won’t be reliable. Your course needs to be comprehensive and the equipment you use (your microscope system) needs to be up to the correct specifications so you’re able to use LBA to its full potential from the beginning. I’ve often seen people who want to add LBA to their practice, but who don’t want to invest in a good enough system, so they start with a very basic system that doesn’t allow them to see everything they should be able to see with LBA and they never really fully benefit from LBA. So the theory, the practical proficiency and the correct equipment are all critically important.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,Requirements
How long does it take to really become proficient at live blood analysis?,"We suggest at a minimum of 4 hours study a week on top of the weekly lesson. The technique of collecting the blood samples is fairly easy to master and most students are completely proficient in this within a month. Most students are also able to identify the most common anomalies correctly within 1-2 months, but it is important to have as much knowledge as possible because clients often ask questions, and some clients are sceptical, so as a practitioner you need to have as much information to draw from as possible. Most practitioners are able to start practicing after 3 months, your proficiency will constantly improve as you see more and more clients and get hands-on experience with LBA.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
How much experience does a person need to start practicing LBA?,"You need to have enough practical experience with the microscope to be able to use the equipment easily and proficiently. You will also need to practice on yourself and anyone willing to let you practice on them until you feel confident enough in your abilitiy to take a good sample. Then you will need to put everything you have been taught on the training course into practise. Most practitioners are able to start practicing after 3 months, your proficiency will constantly improve as you see more and more clients and get hands-on experience with LBA.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
Is Enderlein theory of pleomorphism taught in the course?,"Yes, we cover the theory of pleomorphism in detail with all the phases of development of the particular growth forms identified by Dr Enderlein. Under each anomaly we also discuss the pleomorphic perspective. The training course covers all aspects of live blood analysis so consequently is not exclusively pleomorphic.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
Do you teach phase contrast or darkfield?,"The microscope systems we use are fitted with brightfield and darkfield, so the images you’ll see in the course materials would be either brightfield or darkfield. Phase contrast was developed as a less expensive option to darkfield, but even with the best phase contrast microscope systems you won’t be able to see everything you can with darkfield. That’s why we focus exclusively on brightfield and darkfield analysis of live blood.",,,,Training course general,
What makes this course different from other courses?,"This training course draws from a variety of researchers, whereas other courses only offer one researcher’s viewpoint so you are likely to encounter a lot of information that is not covered in any other single course.
This course is online, interactive, with live lessons and video recordings so attendees can study anywhere in the world. Online training does away with expensive travel and accommodation costs to travel to an in-house training centre where practitioners find they have to learn a huge amount of information in a short amount of time, this is not practical and students find they are not able to take it all in.
No other course offers as much information and detail, plus an online training site with a huge database of images, videos and information.
Plus, back-up and support is provided after the training course ends.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,Microscopes
Is the equipment easy to transport?,For air travel of the microscope you will need the original protective box packaging to send it or you may take it as hand luggage. For general transporting around we suggest a cabin bag (on wheels) fitted out with foam for protection so that you can wheel your microscope around easily. ,,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
How often do you run the courses?,"We run training courses in January, April and September, the courses fill up quickly so do book your place in plenty of time.",,,,,Microscopes
I would like to know if your course is recognized in the USA? I am interested and I would love to enrol in your class if I can practice it here?,"Live blood analysis is becoming recognized all over the world especially in USA, it is a nutritional tool used in a natural health & wellness setting. You will need to adhere to your local health and safety regulations.",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
Would the online training be the best way to take the course or would I need hands on class?,"This training course has been designed to overcome all of the problems involved in in-house training courses. Online training has many advantages: 
This online training course consists of live interactive lessons and video recordings so attendees can study anywhere in the world in any time zone. 
Online training does away with expensive travel and accommodation costs to travel to an in-house training centre where practitioners find they have to learn a huge amount of information in a short amount of time, this is not practical and students find they are not able to take all the information in.
With online training the course material is recorded so attendees can repeat the lessons.
Attendees can study or learn whenever they want at home or office at their own time and convenience.

Could you give me a brief outline of the course and how it is presented?,"The 12 weekly interactve online lessons are presented via GotoWebinar, they consist of in-depth information, videos, diagrams and pictures describing, explaining and discussing  the material in the manual. Questions are posed and answered throughout the lesson and a video recording of the lesson is then sent out to all attendees after the live webinar for those in different time zones or anyone unable to attend for any reason.
",,,Joining a training course,Training course general,
What are some of the common problems that people experience in setting up the new live blood analysis practice?,"The most common problem is not having the right equipment. Live blood analysis darkfield microscopes are very specialized so the microscope system needs to be up to the correct specifications to be able to use LBA to its full potential.
We often see practitoners who want to add LBA to their practice, but who don’t want to invest in a good enough system, so they start with a very basic system that doesn’t allow them to see everything they should be able to see with LBA, consequently they and their clients never really fully benefit from LBA.

Why is your training course superior to other training courses available?,"This LBA training course draws from a variety of researchers, whereas other courses only offer one researcher’s view.

We cover live blood in brightfield and darkfield in great detail, as well as dry blood analysis.

The course is online, interactive, recorded and available any time which does away with workshops that require expensive travel and accommodation and where practitioners are left with just a manual and lacking important information with no back up or help when they start to practice.

No other course offers as much information and detail, plus a huge database of images and videos and charts.

Because the course draws from many researchers so you are likely to encounter a lot of information that is not covered in any other single course.

Our course attendees access their course materials from our Digital Chalk LMS (learning management system), which enables attendees to keep track of their progress, complete self-assessments and access a wealth of additional resources.
The manual is laid out clearly, with clear examples of anomalies in both brightfield and darkfield, and proven interventions to address each specific anomaly.",,,,,
What are the qualifications and experience of the tutor on your course,"Your Tutor is Dr Okker Botha a registered Homeopathic doctor.
Masters: Homeopathy (M.Tech. Hom), HID – Naturopathy (SNSH UK)
Adv. Nutrition (SNHS UK), Adv. Applied Microscopy for Nutritional Evaluation & Correction (NuLife Sciences). Director of Neogenesis Systems.

Dr Okker Botha is a registered homeopathic doctor who has established himself as a leader in Live and Dry Blood Analysis.

Dr Okker has over 17 years experience in his live blood analysis clinical practice as well as training many practitioners world-wide in this exciting technique.

Dr Okker is considered one of the leading authorities in the field of Live Blood Analysis. “Our live blood analysis online training courses are training systems for those who want to learn how to use blood analysis to its full potential.”",,see https://www.neogenesissystems.com/faqs/,,,
Can I join a training course now?,"Yes, attendees can join at any time and catch up with the video recordings of the missed lessons",,,,,
What kind of pc or laptop do the training course & microscope require ? Windows or Apple?,The training course and the microscopes ar compatible with Windows and MAC,,,,,
Do I need a medical background to practice LBA?,"No, LBA is not a medical test and we don’t detect any medical conditions with it. Having a medical background is not a requirement. It is a technique that fits into the scope of natural medicine, nutrition, or as it’s often referred to: CAM complementary and alternative medicine. The imbalances we detect with LBA fits squarely into the realm of complementary medicine, so any person practicing any form of natural health, or working in the field of nutrition, will benefit from using LBA on their clients.",,,,,
Is there any research to back LBA up?,"Yes, there have been a number of studies. It’s often called a “pseudo-science” and criticised in that there is no research behind it. That it’s some kind of gimmick. However, much of what we see in live blood samples have been researched and proven in conventional hematology. There are other anomalies in live and dry blood that were identified clinically by researchers working with live & dry blood analysis many years ago. Many of these relate to conditions that can’t be tested for with conventional investigations, but we always see the anomalies respond to the recommended interventions.

There have been a number of small studies that have shown a very strong correlation between findings in LBA and conventional blood tests. Because LBA is much more sensitive than conventional blood tests this is not something that can be done for all LBA anomalies, but in some of these studies they looked at anomalies that can be easily detected in conventional blood tests, eg anemia indicators in patients with iron deficiency anemia, liver indicators in patients with liver disease etc. LBA was shown to be very accurate in these cases. There was also another study done fairly recently that showed a very strong correlation between specific LBA indicators and metabolic syndrome. These studies are not to the scale required by conventional medicine, but they do show that what we’re seeing in the blood is reliable and stands up to scientific testing.",,,,,
Isn't it better to study hands on?,"We provide the best format to study LBA. What you would learn from hands on training is covered in detail in the course, during the lessons and in the form of videos. We go through the microscope settings and how to take blood samples correctly in detail, and since everything is recorded you can always go back and review if as many times as you like. This is not the case in hands on training, where we found that people forget much of what they learned after a 2 or 3 day hands on course, and then have nowhere to go to review the information.

 ",,,,,
Do you provide back up?,"Yes, we provide email support for our course attendees and full after-sales support with a 2 year warranty on our microscopes. We also have the private FB page where attendees can post questions, interact and continue learning.",,,,,
"Can you give a bit extra detail on what digital materials are included, besides video recordings of weekly live webinars?","The online training materials and USB flash drive contains:

The complete Neogenesis Live & Dry Blood training manual

Instructional videos on all practical aspects of LBA (such as how to prepare a reliable live & dry blood sample; how to view the samples on your microscope using the correct settings for brightfield & darkfield; where one should look in a live sample for reliable results, and more)

"Do I need to start the course at a specific date, or can it be any time? What time are your weekly live webinars in UK time?","The live lessons take place at 7pm (UK time) on Tuesdays. Many of our attendees in the US and Canada are able to attend the live lessons (Tuesday afternoons US time) but since the lessons are recorded, attendees can always catch up with lessons they missed due to other commitments by listening to the recordings and then sending their question in by email.",,,,,
"If the lessons are at night time for PST, do I need to participate in them to get certified? Can I send my questions via email after the webinar?",If you’re not able to attend the live lessons you can access the recordings (available on the training site the day after the live lesson) and send in your questions to us.,,,,,
"After completion of the course, will I be able to get liability insurance in Canada, and from which association?","There is no liability insurance available for LBA specifically – our practitioners in Canada have liability insurance for their practice under their specific treatment modalities (nutrition, herbalism, naturopathy, etc).",,,,,
Is there any scientific proof about Live blood analysis?,https://livebloodonline.com/the-history-of-live-blood-analysis/,,,,,
I would like to know if the training includes recommendations that you give to clients to correct the imbalances or improve the internal terrain depending on what is found or is it just the technique used for the microscope and how to identify the microforms?,"The training includes recommendations to give to clients to correct the imbalances and/or improve the internal terrain depending on what is found.
Solutions are given for all of the anomalies found in the analysis, you will find them in the manual provided. 
LBA is not just the technique used to identify the anomaly, we provide the treatment.
Further live blood analysis then also shows if the treatment is successful.",,,,,
"i'll like to know if you teach us to recognise borrelia, babesia bacteria please?","We don’t cover the identification of borrelia and babesia bacteria specifically, since they can’t be identified on morphology alone. We do provide information on what spirochetes and other cell wall deficient bacteria look like and what has been seen in samples of patients with Babesiosis, as well as other microbes that can be identified in the blood. We can’t diagnose these infections with live blood analysis alone though, so further tests are used to confirm the diagnosis when there are red flags in the analysis.",,,,,
"Does your training include identification of lyme and co-infections?
","We don’t cover Lyme specifically. We do provide information on what spirochetes and other cell wall deficient bacteria look like and how to find them in blood samples, but we are not able to diagnose a Lyme infection with live blood analysis.",,,,,
"When we see bacteria, parasites etc in blood, what can we suggest to patients to help them? Do we have solutions?","We have specific recommended interventions listed under each anomaly, so for parasites and bacteria you’ll be able to see what we recommend. The interventions are based on protocols that have been tested in practice and work in clearing the anomaly. You will be able to see the specific combinations of herbal formulations we use and you will then be able to either order the specific formulation, or source something similar in your own country. We also include specific dietary and lifestyle recommendations under each anomaly.",,,,,
"If I buy your microscope and pay for the training course, will I be able to collaberate with you in future?
","We are always open to collaborating with our attendees. We will provide the support you need to get the most out of live & dry blood analysis, and would be interested at looking at any other suggestions for collaborating that you may have.",,,,,
Do you teach urine and saliva tests too and other body liquids?,"We only cover the analysis of blood under the microscope at this stage. The blood gives us the best information relating to the condition of the body’s terrain. The other fluids are quite limited in their value and mostly relate to conditions in the organs they are found in, whereas the blood provides information on the whole body.",,,,,
"Can you define which bacteria you are seeing with the microscopes you provide?
","We can’t identify specific bacteria under the microscope. We can only see their morphology, and since many bacteria look the same under a microscope we can’t say with 100% certainty what specific bacteria it is. In natural medicine the treatment is usually the same, regardless of the type of bacteria, so identifying the specific bacteria is not as important as in conventional medicines where certain antibiotics are used for certain bacteria. We also focus more on identifying why the bacteria is there and what imbalances in the system allowed for the infection to take place. This is quite different to the conventional approach.",,,,,
"If i am not sure about results, can you help me to explain results  and find solution for the disease?","We offer support to attendees on the private Facebook page, and you can also send through your results by email if you’re not sure about what you’re seeing. We also provide support on recommended treatments for what you identify in the blood.",,,,,
Does LBA require the drawing of blood?,"No, not in terms of drawing blood from a vein with a syringe. A drop of blood is collected from a finger prick – similar to the finger pricks that diabetics have to do to monitor their blood sugar.",,,,,
Where is the best place to get a microscope & how much do they cost?,"We supply the best microscopes for live & dry blood analysis. This is something that’s quite important to discuss, because there are many microscopes on the market that claim to be darkfield microscopes, but they won’t be suitable for LBA. Remember that darkfield is not exclusive to LBA, it’s a technique that’s been used in microscopy for many years. However, the researchers that started working with LBA in darkfield found that there are a very specific set of requirements for a microscope to be suitable to analyse live blood in darkfield. Most commercially available darkfield microscopes don’t have the necessary specifications, so this is a potential pitfall. Having studied LBA and having worked with many different microscopes myself, I’ve researched this expensively and have ensured that the microscopes we offer have the best specifications for LBA. There are many unique features in our systems that are not available on other microscopes, so we believe that any other system is to some extent a compromise. We actually have a separate webinar on this subject, where we explain what you need to look for in a LBA microscope system. https://youtu.be/ZmoH9cpP7Oo",,,,,
Do I need to buy a microscope to take the TC?,"It isn’t necessary to have a microscope at the start of the course. It’s possible to go through the lessons and learn all the theory before going on to the practical aspects where a microscope will be needed. Many of our attendees do it this way, but it is important to mention that we only issue a certificate to an attendee after reviewing their case studies. To complete your 2 case studies you would need access to a microscope. ",,,,,
Are you a member of any governing body or association?,"Yes, we are CMA approved (Complementary Medical Association – UK).",,,,,
"I am in Australia, what about the time difference?","We have attendees from all over the world in different time zones – this is where the recordings are very useful. Attendees in different time zones can view the recordings later and post their questions to the private Facebook page. The fact that the lessons are recorded is also very useful for giving practitioners the ability to go over and review the lessons as many times as they like, and also if you’ve had to miss a lesson for any reason. We believe that by providing the recordings we offer a huge advantage in our training course.",,,,,
Is LBA legal?,"Yes it is. There are some states in the US where the medical council has tried to prevent the practice of LBA, but the technique is not regulated and there are practitioners in those states that are using LBA. Instead of using the term “live blood analysis” they say they’re using it as an educational tool to educate their clients on nutrition, diet & lifestyle. The only real risk is when practitioners make claims about being able to diagnose medical conditions, which is not what LBA should be used for. We cover the legal aspects in detail during the course to ensure that our attendees can use the technique safely without putting themselves or their clients at risk.",,,,,
What’s the difference between medical blood test and LBA?,"We use capillary blood and view the blood in its fresh, unaltered state. In medical blood tests the blood is drawn from a vein and only viewed hours later, after staining the blood, thereby effectively killing the cells. Medical blood tests are used to diagnose medical conditions, LBA is used for prevention……",,,,,
What does LBA show?,"LBA can detect underlying imbalances at the cellular level

LBA helps you to choose best course of treatment

With LBA you can monitor the efficacy of any given treatment

With LBA you can demonstrate the negative effects of an unhealthy diet & lifestyle

With LBA you can create an interactive dynamic in your practice.",,,,,
Can LBA be done on animals?,"Yes, the basic principles and indicators would be the same, but the sampling procedure would need to be adapted to the type of animal being tested. We have some practitioners who have been working with animals and have tested horses and have found it to be very valuable.",,,,,
Do I need a telescope to fallow the course.,"No, at some point you’ll need a microscope, but not a telescope!",,,,,
What kind of illness we we be able to detect from the live blood analysis?,LBA is not used to diagnose illnesses. You’ll be able to uncover the underlying imbalances in the body’s internal environment that have facilitated the development of disease. By addressing those identified imbalances the underlying cause of the disease is then treated.,,,,,
Will we have protocols to offer when we find anomalies in the blood?,"Yes, they are discussed in the course and in detail in the manual",,,,,
"How accurate live blood analysis

","LBA is very accurate when used correctly. The various anomalies and interpretations have been verified by 100s of practitioners using LBA in their practices. If the results were not accurate and reliable it simply won’t work. Patients and practitioners alike would not benefit from it, and it would have whittled away many years ago. Instead we have a growing base of practitioners who use it in their practices. Many of these practitioners are highly qualified and work in the field of integrative medicine.",,,,,
Will I be able to offer Blood cell analysis after the training.,"Yes, we issue a certificate which is CMA approved. Although LBA is not regulated it is important to be able to prove that you’ve received formal training. Most attendees who started working with the correct microscope from early on in the course are able to start offering LBA in their practices at the end of the course. ",,,,,
"What’s the difference between LBA and other tests used by natural health practitioners, such as the quantum analysers and biofeedback devices?",You will be able to help more people with LBA than with any other device used in natural health……,,,,,
Cost of the program.,Cost of the training course $799 USD ,,,,,
Can the training course be started at any time of the year or there are specific months to start the program.,"The training course can be started any time in the year due to being able to catch up with the recordings however, if you would like to attend the live online lessons, the training courses are in September (24th), January and April.",,,,,
I have a microscope already all I need to do is learn how to use it,"We teach how to use your microscope in the first lesson, most microscopes are quite similar but our course tutor may be able to help you with any issues.",,,,,
I would like to know if it is the same course that gets played over in cycles or is it a fresh course on every cycle ?,"Everytraining new course is presented live, you will also receive a video recording of the lesson.",,,,,
What does your training cover related to infection prevention and control?,"We can also see signs of infection in the blood samples, but this is not the main use of the analysis. We can see whether the immune system is coping, because we’re able to observe the white blood cells while they’re still alive, and we can see what factors in the terrain have allowed for infections to take hold. One of the main benefits of the analysis is that we’re able to see things that other tests can’t, which allows us to help patients that have had other investigations that have not detected the cause of their symptoms. For example, in cardiovascular risk, we can observe the level of activity of the thrombocytes by looking for thrombocyte aggregation. These are usually very obvious as large groups of aggregated thrombocytes, and are very important in cardiovascular risk.",,,,,
I have been doing non invasive procedures in my practice how much higher will the liability insurance be for getting a drop of blood from a client?,"In my experience an insurance co will just add the practice of live blood analysis to your existing policy if you already have one.

If you don't have a policy yet - insurance for live blood analysis is usually no more expensive than most other naturopathic treatments.

What regulations may be needed to be adhered to are Sharps containers and disposal regulations (most clinics/health centres usually have these in place for acupuncture, blood sugar testing etc.",,,,,
Would you be able to provide your clinical experience with menopausal concerns using LBA and DBA?,"Live and dry blood analysis will be a valuable tool for you in dealing with these cases. There is a wealth of information that can be uncovered with this technique and it is extremely useful in any natural health practice. I worked with fertility problems for many years in my own practice and had great results in these cases, as well as in menopause. We’re not able to see the actual levels of individual hormones with this test, but since we’re working with the whole person and not just the endocrine system alone, we can see the underlying imbalances that are the foundation of the patient’s condition. For example adrenal stress, liver challenges, toxicity / oxidative stress, digestive imbalances, leaky gut syndrome, etc. Working on these imbalances usually leads to success with nearly any condition.
",,,,,
Do you offer any payment plan?,"We offer a 2 part payment plan, 50% to begin the training course and the remaining 50% on week 6 which is half way through the 12 week training course.",,,,,
Are the protocols for clients included in the training course?,"Yes, all the protocols are provided in great detail as part of the training course.",,,,,
What type of license do we need to get in order to work doing the blood analysis?,"There isn’t any specific association or governing body for Live blood analysis and the type of license if any will depend on your country's specific regulations if there are.

LBA is not regulated as a medical practice as it isn’t a diagnostic procedure, so any practitioner who has received training is able to use LBA. We do cover the legal aspects in more detail in the training course.

The procedure does not draw blood, just a tiny pinprick is used via a lancet as in a blood sugar test.
A procedure for removal of refuse will need to be followed, similar to what an acupuncture practice will have in place.",,,,,
"Would it be possible to offer LDA for remote clients? In other words, send them collection kits and slides which they could express ship for me to view the next day? Or would the RBC die too rapidly to be of any use?","the blood has to be live for live blood analysis, so it is not possible for live blood analysis. Some practitioners do this with dry blood analysis as this can be done by mail. ",,asking Alec to add to website 24 08 22,,,
Do we get some form of certification that we finished/attended the course?,"You will be sent a Complementary Medical Association Accredited certificate on completion of the training course and submission of a case study.

Case studies are covered in lessons 10, 11 and 12

Please see https://livebloodonline.com/q-a/",,,,,
certificate,"Thank you for your enquiry.We issue a certificate after completion of the course and submission of a case study (along with completing the answering of some questions on the training site),You will need to adhere to your country's regulations as with any health practice to practice in your country.Elizabeth",,,,,
"I would love to take the course , do you have any info if we can start with more affordable microscopes.","Live blood analysis requires a very specialized microscope to see all of the anomalies, if you want to practice live blood analysis to its full potential and help clients, you need a microscope that has this capability and they are not cheap. We have our microscopes specially made for us at the lowest price possible. Anything less will not allow you to do a full analysis which will not help your clients.
